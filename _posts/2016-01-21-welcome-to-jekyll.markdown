Hello and welcome to Code Journal. I decided to start this site as a way to track my experiments in code. It likely wont be pretty for awhile but I thought the best way to continue learning and push myself was to document my daily coding. The goal of this site is to document what I'm building.

Earlier today I pair programmed with a few friends using Screenhero. They had set up a basic blog site using Jekyll and we did a bit of tweaking. I really like the little bit of Jekyll I saw so decided to come home and play around with it. Jekyll can be used for static sites and defaults to a blog set up so a blog was a natural option. I don't plan to spend a lot of time beautifying this site yet wanted to make something that mattered, hence the code journal.
